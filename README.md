Updating the Curzon Street model
---------------------------------

When updating the FBX file, the filename should be changed to `Curzon St Station.fbx` before import into Unity, and the existing file overwritten; this is to ensure that the Curzon St *prefab* auto-updates correctly. After updating, please check the prefab or the game scene to make sure that the update is successful and hasn't corrupted collider positions, etc.
